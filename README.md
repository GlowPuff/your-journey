# Your Journey - Early ALPHA release
The companion playback app for my Journeys in Middle Earth Scenario Editor.

Hit "New Game" at the title and load your level on the next screen.

## LIMITATIONS:
-no saving of game state

-if you add too many monsters they will stack right off the screen

-no Settings panel - the Settings button does nothing, **so use ALT+F4 to quit**

-no Party management panel - the Party button does nothing

-battle map scenarios not supported - work on battle maps hasn't even been started yet, even though you can design them in the editor

## The Scenario Editor
The editor is available in [a separate repository](https://github.com/GlowPuff/JiMEditor).
